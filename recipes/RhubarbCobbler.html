		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
			<li>4 cups chopped rhubarb</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup cold butter, cubed</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch square baking dish. </li>
			<li>To make the filling: Mix sugar and cornstarch together in a large saucepan. Stir in rhubarb and water. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Dot with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. </li>
            <li>To make the topping: Sift together flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat together milk and egg in a small bowl; add to flour mixture all at once and stir until just moistened. </li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of topping over rhubarb filling. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven rhubarb is bubbling and topping is crisp and lightly browned, about 20 minutes. </li>
